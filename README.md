# Charity Tasker

This project was initially created with the focus of providing more donations to several charities through aa social media platform. The goal was to have a website where the challenges need to be completed once donations have reached their goals. 

It was created using MERN - MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js.


## Currently waiting on Deployment:

This should be completed using Heroku for the front end, and Netlify for the back-end.

## To Do

* Still working on front-end Charities page not showing the footer if possible.
* Need to create more links based on the category of the challenge
* Video upload in the challenge page. The goal is that a video must be uploaded before a user can click on the "Completed" status. 
* Seperate challenges based on status (incomplete vs completed)
* insert pages to the "Challenges" lists.
* Stripe test integration.
